Category,Description,Use,Type
Building footprints,2D polygons of the building footprint,Geometric calculations and estimations involving individual and gross floor area,Primary
Building height,Height of the building. Often comprised of two measurements - eave height and ridge height,Used to construct 3D volumes and surfaces from 2D data,Primary
3D building model,3D volumetric model of the building comprised of surfaces. Varying levels of detail,Provides geometric information about the outer shape of the building,Primary
Digital elevation model,Evenly spaced elevation values referenced to a projection or coordinate system,Determines the horizon line and location of shading objects for radiation calculations,Primary
Built form,Descriptive information about the relationship with other buildings,Determines the boundary conditions for simulation by identifying shared and exposed walls,Primary
"Thermal envelope (wall, roof, floor, glazing types)",Detailed information on the construction and materials used in the elements of the building envelope,The thermophysical properties of the building elements are used in the simulation to calculate heat flows,Primary
Building age,Age of the building or time since the last retrofit,Infer typical building materials based on regulations at the time of construction/refurbishment,Secondary
Building use,Usage category of a building,"Used to determine internal schedules, temperature and humidity set points required for simulation",Secondary
Occupant Composition,"Detailed information about the number, type, age-group of the inhabitants of the building",Used to determine load schedules specific to an occupant type,Secondary
Tenure,"Provides information on whether the house is owner occupied, rented or is a social housing","Used to infer information about construction, refurbishment status or sceduling",Secondary
Building Energy System,"Existence and parameters of energy systems (Renewables, HVAC, Lighting and DHW) in the building.",Used in calculations to determine the effciency of the energy system and resulting demand profiles,Primary/Secondary
Address Data,The street address of a building,"Can be used for aggregation, clustering and linking. Address data could also be used to infer information about the age or use of a building.",Secondary
Building Typology,Parameterised buildings models representing a specific category,Used to populate the parameters of missing or questionable data records,Tertiary
Stock Development,"Rates for a new building construction, building demolition and/or building refurbishment.",The stock development data acts as independet parameter that 'drives' a possible stock development forecast.,Tertiary
Energy Generation and Distribution,The availability and description of district heating or external energy resources (e.g. CHP) as well as grid accessibility.,Used to evaluate the reliance and influence of the building on external energy systems,NA
Weather Data,Environmental variables experienced by the building over the simulated period,Directly used in the simulation to determine boundary conditions and heat flows,Primary
